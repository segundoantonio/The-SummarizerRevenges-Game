# Randomizer Revenges

**About the Project:**

This is our first group project, developed during our 4th week at <Academia de CÃ³digo_> Lisbon. We were challenged to create a game applying the technologies we had learned in the previous weeks. The project deployment deadline was 10 nights.

**Description:**

The-SummarizerRevenges is an exciting adventure game that challenges players to face numerous challenges in a dynamic and unpredictable world. The game incorporates the concepts and technologies we've learned during our weeks of training at the academy, making it a showcase of our newly acquired skills.
